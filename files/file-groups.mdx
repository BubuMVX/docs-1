title: "File Groups"
---

Groups allow you to organize your Pinata content through the Pinata App or through the Pinata API, giving you a clearer picture of what your files are being used for.

## Public vs Private Groups

Groups help determine if a file uploaded through the Files API is private or publicly accessible. All file uploads are private by default, unless a file is:

- Uploaded to a public group
- Added to a public group
- Is part of a group that is updated to public

At this point the file can be accessed publicly without a signed URL. For more info read the docs on [retrieving files](/gateways/retrieving-files).

Groups can either be public upon creation or updated after the fact, as laid out below.

## SDK and API

With the [SDK](/sdk/groups), you can create groups, add files to groups, list details about a group, and more! You can also mange groups using the [Pinata API](/api-reference/endpoint/create-group).

### Create a Group

To create a group you can use the [create](/sdk/groups/create) method and passing in the `name` you want to give a group.

```typescript
import { PinataSDK } from "pinata";

const pinata = new PinataSDK({
  pinataJwt: process.env.PINATA_JWT!,
  pinataGateway: "example-gateway.mypinata.cloud",
});

const group = await pinata.groups.create({
	name: "My New Group",
  isPublic: true
});
```

This will return the Group info

```typescript
{
    id: "01919976-955f-7d06-bd59-72e80743fb95",
    name: "Test Private Group",
    is_public: true,
    created_at: "2024-08-28T14:49:31.246596Z"
}
```

### Add or Remove Files from a Group

There are two ways you can add files to a group. The first is to add the file to a group on [upload](/sdk/upload/file).

```typescript
const upload = await pinata.upload
  .file(file)
  .group("b07da1ff-efa4-49af-bdea-9d95d8881103")
```

Another option is to add files after the fact using the [addFiles](/sdk/groups/add-files) method.

```typescript
const upload = await pinata.groups.addFiles({
  groupId: "b07da1ff-efa4-49af-bdea-9d95d8881103",
  files: [
    "0ed5738f-07e7-4587-81fb-f04f8be15d77",
    "a277dc29-2ca3-4dfb-aeb9-3f2b23e956f7"
  ]
})
```

Removing files can be done the exact same way with the [removeFiles](/sdk/groups/remove-files) method.

```typescript
const upload = await pinata.groups.removeFiles({
  groupId: "b07da1ff-efa4-49af-bdea-9d95d8881103",
  files: [
    "0ed5738f-07e7-4587-81fb-f04f8be15d77",
    "a277dc29-2ca3-4dfb-aeb9-3f2b23e956f7"
  ]
})
```

### Get a Group

To fetch details of an already existing group you can use the [get](/sdk/groups/get) and pass in the `groupId`.

```typescript
const groups = await pinata.groups.get({
	groupId: "3778c10d-452e-4def-8299-ee6bc548bdb0",
});
```

This will return the same group info received upon creation.

```typescript
{
    id: "0191997b-ca28-79e8-9dbc-a8044ad3e547",
    name: "My New Group 5",
    is_public: false,
    created_at: "2024-08-28T14:55:12.448504Z",
}
```

### List All Groups

If you want to get all Groups or filter through them, you can use the [list](/sdk/groups/list) method.

```typescript
const groups = await pinata.groups.list()
```

Results can be filtered with the following queries.

#### name

- Type: `boolean`

Filters groups based on the group name

```typescript
const groups = await pinata.groups
    .list()
    .name("SDK")
```

#### isPublic

- Type: `boolean`

Filters groups based on whether they are public or not

```typescript
const groups = await pinata.groups
    .list()
    .isPublic(true)
```

#### limit

- Type: `number`

Limits the number of results

```typescript
const groups = await pinata.groups
    .list()
    .limit(10)
```

This will return an array of Groups and their respective info:

```typescript
[
  {
    id: "0191997b-ca28-79e8-9dbc-a8044ad3e547",
    name: "My New Group 5",
    is_public: false,
    created_at: "2024-08-28T14:55:12.448504Z",
  }
]
```

### Updating a Group

You can update the name of a group or it's public status using the [update](/sdk/groups/update) method and passing in the `groupId, a new `name` you want to use, or setting the `isPublic` boolean.

```typescript
const groups = await pinata.groups.update({
	groupId: "3778c10d-452e-4def-8299-ee6bc548bdb0",
	name: "My New Group 2",
  isPublic: true
});
```

This will return the updated Group info.

```json
{
    "id": "3778c10d-452e-4def-8299-ee6bc548bdb0",
    "name": "My New Group 2",
    "is_public": false,
    "created_at": "2024-08-28T20:58:46.96779Z"
}
```

### Delete a Group

<Note>
  Deleting a Group that has CIDs inside of it will not unpin/delete the files. Please use the [delete](/sdk/files/delete) method to actually delete a file from your account
</Note>

To delete a Group you can use the [delete](/sdk/groups/delete) method and pass in the `groupId`.

```typescript
const groups = await pinata.groups.delete({
	groupId: "3778c10d-452e-4def-8299-ee6bc548bdb0",
});
```

If successful, the endpoint will return an `OK` response.
