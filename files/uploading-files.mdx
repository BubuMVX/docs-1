At the core of Pinata is file uploads through our File API. It's fast and easy to use, whether you're using the [SDK](/sdk) or the [API](/api-reference). Something unique about the Files API is that all files are given a unique Content Identifier or `CID`. These are not like normal IDs in that they are content addressable hashes based on the contents of the file. You can upload the same file over and over and it will always return the same CID. This has multiple benefits including:
    - Deduplication: Since a duplicate file would have the same CID, it is not included upon upload and reduces the amount of files in your account. This keeps things organized and reduces your total costs.
    - Versioning: Tracking the history of a file requires proprietary solutions built on top of the data storage provider and does not expose that history and provenance in a meaningful way to everyone who needs to access it.

Let's look at the multiple ways you can upload files!

## Using the SDK

The Pinata SDK is able to handle mutliple kinds of uploads, whether its file objects, base64 strings, or even content from remote URLs.

```typescript
import { PinataSDK } from "pinata";

const pinata = new PinataSDK({
  pinataJwt: process.env.PINATA_JWT!,
  pinataGateway: "example-gateway.mypinata.cloud",
});

const file = new File(["hello"], "Testing.txt", { type: "text/plain" });
const upload = await pinata.upload.file(file);
```

## Using the API

The API is a bit more flexible, as it can be used in multiple languages or environments, and is sometimes preferred for client side uploads. With that, we should express warning in that client side applications will expose API keys.

<Warning>
  Using your API Keys in a client side application will expose them! Consider using a [signed JWT approach](https://www.pinata.cloud/blog/how-to-upload-to-ipfs-from-the-frontend-with-signed-jwts).
</Warning>

The API accepts `File` objects (and blobs in the right environment) through a multipart form data request, where the object has a key of `file`.

```javascript
const JWT = "YOUR_PINATA_JWT";

async function upload() {
  try {
    const formData = new FormData();

    const file = new File(["hello"], "Testing.txt", { type: "text/plain" });
    formData.append("file", file);

    const request = await fetch("https://uploads.pinata.cloud/v3/files", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${JWT}`,
      },
      body: formData,
    });
    const response = await request.json();
    console.log(response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}
```

### Upload Progress

If you happen to use the API as well as local files you can also track the progress of the upload using a library like `got`. Better support for upload progress will come in later versions of the SDK!

```typescript
import fs from "fs";
import FormData from "form-data";
import got from "got";

async function upload() {
  const url = `https://uploads.pinata.cloud/v3/files`;
  try {
    let data = new FormData();
    data.append(`file`, fs.createReadStream("path/to/file"));
    const response = await got(url, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.PINATA_JWT}`,
      },
      body: data,
    }).on("uploadProgress", (progress) => {
      console.log(progress);
    });
    console.log(JSON.parse(response.body));
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}
```

If your file is larger than 100MB then a better approach is to follow the [Resumable Upload Guide](#resumable-uploads)

## Common File Recipes

Below are some common recipes for uploading a file.

### Blob

Usually you can pass a Blob directly into the request but to help guarantee success we recommend passing it into a `File` object.

```typescript Blob
import { PinataSDK } from "pinata";

const pinata = new PinataSDK({
  pinataJwt: process.env.PINATA_JWT!,
  pinataGateway: "example-gateway.mypinata.cloud",
});

const text = "Hello World!";
const blob = new Blob([text], { type: "text/plain" });
const file = new File(["hello world!"], "hello.txt", { type: "text/plain" });
const upload = await pinata.upload.file(file);
```

### JSON

Pinata makes it easy to upload JSON objects using the [json](/ipfs-sdk/upload/json) method.

```typescript JSON
import { PinataSDK } from "pinata";

const pinata = new PinataSDK({
  pinataJwt: process.env.PINATA_JWT!,
  pinataGateway: "example-gateway.mypinata.cloud",
});

const upload = await pinata.upload.json({
  id: 2,
  name: "Bob Smith",
  email: "bob.smith@example.com",
  age: 34,
  isActive: false,
  roles: ["user"],
});
```

### Local Files

If you need to upload files from a local file source you can use `fs` to feed a file into a `blob`, then turn that `blob` into a `File`.

```typescript
const { PinataSDK } = require("pinata");
const fs = require("fs");
const { Blob } = require("buffer");

const pinata = new PinataSDK({
  pinataJwt: process.env.PINATA_JWT!,
  pinataGateway: "example-gateway.mypinata.cloud",
});

const blob = new Blob([fs.readFileSync("./hello-world.txt")]);
const file = new File([blob], "hello-world.txt", { type: "text/plain" });
const upload = await pinata.upload.file(file);
```

### URL

To upload a file from an external URL you can stream the contents into an `arrayBuffer`, which then gets passed into a new `Blob` that can then be uploaded to Pinata. This has been abstracted in the SDK using the [url](/ipfs-sdk/upload/url) method.

```typescript URL
import { PinataSDK } from "pinata";

const pinata = new PinataSDK({
  pinataJwt: process.env.PINATA_JWT!,
  pinataGateway: "example-gateway.mypinata.cloud",
});

const upload = await pinata.upload.url("https://i.imgur.com/u4mGk5b.gif");
```

### base64

To upload a file in base64 simply turn the contents into a `buffer` that is passed into a `Blob`. Alternatively you can use the SDK for this as well using the [base64](/ipfs-sdk/upload/base64) method.

```typescript base64
import { PinataSDK } from "pinata";

const pinata = new PinataSDK({
  pinataJwt: process.env.PINATA_JWT!,
  pinataGateway: "example-gateway.mypinata.cloud",
});

const upload = await pinata.upload.base64("SGVsbG8gV29ybGQh");
```

## Resumable Uploads

The Files API upload endpoint `https://uploads.pinata.cloud/v3/files` is fully [TUS](https://tus.io) compatible, so it can support larger files with the ability to resume uploads. Any file upload larger than 100MB needs to be uploaded through the TUS method. The [Files SDK](/sdk) handles this automatically when you use `pinata.upload.file()` by checking the file size before uploading.

```typescript {6}
const pinata = new PinataSDK({
  pinataJwt: process.env.PINATA_JWT!,
  pinataGateway: "example-gateway.mypinata.cloud",
});

const upload = await pinata.upload.file(massiveFile);
```

If you want to take advantage of resumable uploads then we would recommend using one of the [TUS clients](https://tus.io/implementations) and taking note of the following:

- Upload chunk size must be smaller than 50MB
- Instead of using the form data fields for `group_id` or `keyvalues` these can be passed directly into the upload metadata (see example below)
- Headers must include the Authorization with your [Pinata JWT](/account-managemnet/api-keys)

Here is an example of an upload to Pinata using the `tus-js-client`

```typescript
import * as tus from "tus-js-client";

async function resumeUpload(file) {
  try {
    const upload = new tus.Upload(file, {
      endpoint: "https://uploads.pinata.cloud/v3/files",
      chunkSize: 50 * 1024 * 1024, // 50MiB chunk size
      retryDelays: [0, 3000, 5000, 10000, 20000],
      onUploadUrlAvailable: async function () {
        if (upload.url) {
          console.log("Upload URL is available! URL: ", upload.url);
        }
      },
      metadata: {
        filename: "candyroad-demo.mp4", // name
        filetype: "video/mp4",
        group_id: "0192868e-6144-7685-9fc5-af68a1e48f29", // group ID
        keyvalues: JSON.stringifiy({ env: "prod" }), // keyvalues
      },
      headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.PINATA_JWT}` }, // auth header
      uploadSize: fileStats.size,
      onError: function (error) {
        console.log("Failed because: " + error);
      },
      onProgress: function (bytesUploaded, bytesTotal) {
        const percentage = ((bytesUploaded / bytesTotal) * 100).toFixed(2);
        console.log(percentage + "%");
      },
      onSuccess: function () {
        console.log("Upload completed!");
      },
    });

    upload.start();
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}
```

## Web App

You can also use the **[Pinata App](https://app.pinata.cloud/)** to upload files. It’s as simple as clicking the “Upload” button in the top right corner of the **[files page](https://app.pinata.cloud/pinmanager)**. Select your file, give it a name, then upload. Once it's complete you’ll see it listed in the files page.
